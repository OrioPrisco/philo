take left/right fork first depending on philo_id % 2

pthread_start takes a void * => pass a struct

struct s_philo
{
	philo_id
	pointer to one_philo_died //simulation must stop if a philo dies anywhere +sem/mutex
	*left_fork //if there is only 1 philo, there is only 1 fork, so check for null once, or make a special cheat case idk
	*right_fork
	semaphore/mutex/whatevr can_print
}
